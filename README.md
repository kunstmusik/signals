# Signals

A Clojure library for working with time-varying signals. 

## Highlights

* Pure Clojure, builds upon IRef/IDeref.
* Treats standard Clojure Atoms, Refs, Agents as time-varying, mutable signals. Users should use these in the normal way.
* Adds reactive events and signals that uses the watches feature of Clojure's IRef's. Reactive signals can also be watched by other reactive signals and events.
* Graph of signals and events can be dynamically modified. Reactors can be enabled and disabled.
* Builds upon the apply!\*! operator, which applies a function with dynamic args.  Used as the basis of lifting functions to work on signals.
* Signals can be lazy or strict: lazy signals do not update their values until they are dereferenced, while strict signals are updated immediately when dependents notify of a change.
* Seeks to make code that works with mutable values "highly visible" as well as isolated to be as small an area of the total codebase as possible. 
* Work with projections of data (CursorSignals) as a view upon a larger signal.  Allows reads from/writes to CursorSignals that operate with the original signal. 

## Usage

Please see the [documentation](doc/intro.md) for further information about the library.
